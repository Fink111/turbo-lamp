This code gives out a chrismas tree with a chosen height of 1-5, with an optional star on top. To execute this code, you have to first type in your values at the top of the code(int height = (1-5);bool star = (true/false)). After you copied the code into Visual Studio, activate "Run" at the top and a window will open with your generated chrismas tree.
